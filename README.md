# UFOs
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive web page that would allow users to find UFO sightings based on criteria of Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of object sighted. In this way, citizen researchers may be able to get canofirmation of their own data or find information such as where the most UFOs have been seen, their typical shape and appearances, time of year that they are sighted, etc. 

## Results
The website allows users to filter sighting data based on the search criteria. As seen in the photo below, the data is searched based on any or multiple search criteria. If no events match the search criteria, the page will default to showing all data.

The line chart found below tells a similar story. The stark difference between Rural and Urban fares per week is shown clearly on this chart. There is some fluctuation according to the time of year, but nothing that can really be called conclusive. In order to understand trends in use of PyBer according to the time of year, a larger sampling would need to be considered, with at least a year of data and preferably two or more, in order to clearly identify trends.

## Summary
The main drawback of this search page is the limitation of the data provided. Users will only discover events if they are part of the database that this particluar site is built upon, and that is limited. An exciting element would be to make the page even more dynamic, by allowing users to log events for the developers. If events are logged multiple times or confirmed by multiple users, developers could use that information to update the database, so it could become a repository for sightings that would grown over time, much a wiki page.
